      <b>The Web</b>
      <p>
        The web works by a user sitting at his or her computer and using a brower to send a request to an external server via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a>. The server responds to that request and via the
        Hypertext Transfer Protocol the requested data appears in the users browser.

      <b>HTML</b>
      <p>
        <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> is a collection standardized markup codes (through a series of individual tags, which makes up an element) used to instruct a browser on how display text, images or video.

      <b>HTML Markup</b>
      <p>
        HTML markup is made up of tags and content. <em>The Markup</em> usually consist of a <em>opening tag</em> and a <em>closing tag</em>, with the content needing to be displayed resides in the middle.

      <b>HTML Attributes</b>
      <p>
        HTML Attributes are elements made up of a <em>tag name</em>, <em>attribute name</em> and an <em>attribute value</em>. It's important to note that tags can have more then one attribute.

      <b>HTML Tag (html)</b>
      <p>
        There is the opening tag and a closing tag.. this instructs the website to open the HTML page and close the HTML page.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="concepts">
      <b>Head Tag (Head)</b>
      <p> Is where you put what is relevant to the entire webpage. Also, what commonly goes here is the WebPage title.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="concepts">
      <b>Body Tag (body)</b>
      <p>Like the HTML tag, there is an opening and closing HTML tag. Between those two tags you'll insert content that the user will see when your site is pulled up in a web browser. So this includes: pictures, text and/or video.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="concepts">
      <b>Header Tag (h1-h6)</b>
      <p>
        Heading options are for titles and subtitles. The heading starts at "1" which is the biggest, and it goes up to "6" which is the smallest text. For instance, everything in "h1" would be big and bold, and it subsequently gets smaller as the number increases.
        However it's important not to over use the H tags (meaning don't use them if your just trying to bold text, use (strong) or (b) tag for bolding) because search engines use the Headings for determining search results.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="concepts">
      <b>Paragraph Tag (p)</b>
      <p>
        Where you will write the majority of your content. These normally go under a <em>heading tag.</em>

      <b>Inline Vs. Block Elements</b>
      <p>
        Some common inline elements include: <em>br</em>, <em>a</em>, <em>em</em>, <em>span</em>, <em>img</em> and <em>strong</em>. Conversely, some common block elements are comprised of the <em>p</em>, <em>div</em> tags. It's important to note that
        block elements creates an invisible box around the text, which has height and weight dimensions. Whereas, inline elements do not create a box around the text--it's simply text.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="concepts">
      <b>Span Vs. Div Elements</b>
      <p>
        They can both have content. The one main difference is the <em>span tag</em> is an inline element. And <em>div tag</em> is a block element. Both <em>span</em> and <em>div</em> are both considered container elements. So they do nothing but house
        their content. You can adjust the style of these by adding different attributes to them. Both <em>div</em> and <em>p</em> (both block elements) behave similarly, in the sense they both create an invisible box around the content they surround,
        forcing any text existing to the right of the closing <em>div tag</em> to show up on the next line down.

		Lesson 2 Notes: Structure & Display of an HTML Document
    </h1>
	<div class="concepts">
        <b>Tree-Like Structure (DOM)</b>
        <p> An HTML tree structure or <em>DOM (Document Object Model)</em> is the logical way of showing the hierarchy & relationship between elements that contain other elements within them .You could visualize this document structure by thinking a parent-child
          relationship.

      <div class="concepts">
        <h4>HTML & CSS</h4>
        <p>
          HTML, of course, is the markup language we use to define the content and the structure of a webpage. Next, CSS is what we use to control the visual aspect of specific elements on a page
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div class="concepts">
          <b>HTML and Boxes</b>
          <p> 
            Everything on a webpage has an invisible box around it. A webpage consist of various elements, from the images, headers, footers and text which should be thought of as individual boxes. If the developer thinks in terms of those elements being
            in boxes, it'll make it easier to see how he or she could design--or redesign--the layout of the entire page. Once a document has been cut up into boxes, you want to know the purpose of the boxes(e.g., what they are or where they go) so you
            assign them <em>class attributes</em>; which is done to give these elements style.

            <b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</b>
            <p>
              After structuring a webpage using HTML, the next next is to add style to the page.  So in order to add this style we use something called CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) which describes how the elements should look.   As websites grow in size it would become all to cumbersome to use a markup language like HTML to edit the page and apply a uniform style.  Thus, in it's place we apply style sheets which easily alter and change to the appearance of the page or multiple pages.

        <div class="concepts">
            <b>Selectors</b>
            <p>
              In order to style a particular element in your document, you'll use something called selectors .  The selector defines which set of elements that a specific style with be attributed to.   In other words, the selectors can be applied to all specified elements,  or to specific attributes.  Two common selectors are the <em>id</em> (distinctively selects an element with the specified id) and <em>class</em> (which styles a group of elements sharing the same attribute).

           <b>Ways to Apply CSS</b>
            <div class="applying-style">
             <ul>
              <li>Writing the code in a separte file</li>
              <li>Place the CSS code bewteen the head tags of the html document</li>
              <li>Write the code inline with your HTML (not recommended however)</li>

     <div class="concepts">
       <b>The Box-Model</b>
       <p> 
         The box model in CSS is made up of 4 components: margins, border, padding and content.  In the middle of this box is where are content goes (images or text).  The next layer called the padding—the outer box just outside of the content—which seeks to protect the content portion.  The layer is surrounded by the border, and finally the border is surrounded by the margin—which is transparent and is serves as the space between other boxes.
